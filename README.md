# ABSTRACT:
In this project Store Sales Prediction using machine learning and python, the task is to predict the sales of different stores based on the attributes available in the dataset. Predictive analytics can help us to study and discover the factors that determine the number of sales that a retail store will have in the future by using different machine learning techniques and trying to determine the best algorithm suited to our particular problem statement. We have implemented normal regression techniques and as well as boosting techniques in our approach and have found that the boosting algorithms have better results than the regular regression algorithms.
